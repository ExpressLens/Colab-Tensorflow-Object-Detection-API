Use Tensorflow's Object Detection API in Google Colab. This repository includes a notebook illustrating the step-by-step process.

ExpressLens has gathered some useful links to aid you in the process:

* [Tensorflow Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
* [Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
* [Object Detection Tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb) (This project is inspired by this tutorial).
